  ** "grpregOverlap" now works for survival analysis (Cox model) if specifying
      "family = cox". Related methods for survival analysis, like 
      cv.grpsurvOverlap, predict.grpsurvOverlap, are added. The generic functions,
      like plot, summary, predict can also handle survival model fitting and
      cross-validation.
	*  Handle cases where variables in X are not included in "group" input.
